"""
Datasets for movie genre classification benchmark.

This module contains the training and test datasets used to demonstrate
the differences between DSPy, Atomic Agents, and the combined approach.

Dataset Design:
- Training: 60 examples balanced across 6 genres (10 each)
- Test: 30 challenging examples testing edge cases

The test set is intentionally difficult, including:
- Sarcasm and irony
- Multi-genre signals (primary genre detection)
- Misleading genre keywords
- Subverted expectations
- Subtle/ambiguous signals
- Cultural references
