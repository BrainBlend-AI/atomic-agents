# Atomic Scraper Tool

## Overview
The Atomic Scraper Tool is a utility within the Atomic Agents ecosystem designed for scraping web content and converting it to markdown format. It includes features for extracting metadata and cleaning up the content for better readability.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

- pydantic
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- markdownify
- readability-lxml

## Installation
You can install the tool using any of the following options:

1. Using the CLI tool that comes with Atomic Agents. Simply run `atomic` and select the tool from the list of available tools. After doing so you will be asked for a target directory to download the tool into.
2. Good old fashioned copy/paste: Just like any other tool inside the Atomic Forge, you can copy the code from this repo directly into your own project, provided you already have atomic-agents installed according to the instructions in the main [README](/README.md).

- `max_content_length` (int): Maximum content length in bytes to process. Defaults to 1,000,000.

### Example

```python
config = AtomicScraperToolConfig(
    user_agent="Custom User Agent String",
    timeout=60,
    max_content_length=2_000_000
)
```

## Input & Output Structure

### Input Schema
- `url` (HttpUrl): URL of the Webpage to scrape.
- `include_links` (bool): Whether to preserve hyperlinks in the markdown output. Defaults to True.

### Output Schema

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Atomic Scraper Tool:

```python
from tool.atomic_scraper import AtomicScraperTool, AtomicScraperToolConfig

# Initialize the tool
scraper = AtomicScraperTool(config=AtomicScraperToolConfig())

# Define input data
input_data = AtomicScraperTool.input_schema(
    url="https://example.com/article",
    include_links=True
)

# Perform the scraping
result = scraper.run(input_data)
print(f"Title: {result.metadata.title}")
print(f"Content: {result.content[:200]}...")  # Preview first 200 chars
```
