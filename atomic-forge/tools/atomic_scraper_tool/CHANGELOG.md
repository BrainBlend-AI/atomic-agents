### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

#### Model Provider Injection Pattern
- **Context Adaptability**: Same tool works standalone or orchestrated
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shared connections and rate limiting
- **Consistency**: All agents use the same model configuration
- **Testability**: Easy to inject mock clients for testing
- **Scalability**: Proper resource management in multi-agent scenarios

#### Execution Modes
- **Standalone Mode**: Independent operation with environment-based configuration
- **Orchestrated Mode**: Coordinated with other agents using injected model providers
- **Demo Mode**: Mock responses for testing and demonstration

#### Ecosystem Integration
- **Factory Functions**: `create_orchestrated_app()` for seamless integration
- **Metadata API**: `get_orchestration_metadata()` for ecosystem discovery
- **Client Injection**: Support for any instructor-compatible client
- **Configuration Inheritance**: Flexible configuration management

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

#### Core Components
- **Application Layer** (`main.py`): Entry point with dual-mode initialization
- **Agent Layer** (`agents/`): AI-powered planning and coordination
- **Tool Layer** (`tools/`): Core scraping functionality
- **Configuration Layer** (`config/`): Centralized configuration management
- **Analysis Layer** (`analysis/`): Website analysis and strategy generation
- **Compliance Layer** (`compliance/`): Ethical scraping features
- **Testing Layer** (`testing/`): Mock websites and test scenarios

#### Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Clean object creation for different contexts
- **Strategy Pattern**: Context-appropriate initialization strategies
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling and easy testing
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time monitoring and reporting
