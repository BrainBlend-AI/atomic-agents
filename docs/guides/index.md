- Test provider switching

### Production Deployment

- Load balancing between providers
- Failover configurations
- Cost optimization strategies
- Performance monitoring

### Custom Provider Integration

- Extend Instructor for new providers
- Implement custom client wrappers
- Add provider-specific features
- Handle unique response formats

## Best Practices

### Error Handling

- Implement proper exception handling
- Add retry mechanisms
- Log provider errors
